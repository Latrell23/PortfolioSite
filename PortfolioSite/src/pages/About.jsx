                    I am a software engineer with a unique background in art and animation.
                    <br />
                    Originally from Memphis, TN, I discovered my passion for technology during college,
                    <br />
                    where I found that programming provided the perfect balance of
                    <br />
                    creative expression and logical problem-solving.
                </p>

                    I am driven by the reward of building functional, user-centric solutions.
                    <br />
                    I approach code with a designer's eye and an engineer's mind,
                    <br />
                    ensuring that what I build is not only efficient but also intuitive.

                    Currently, I am seeking opportunities in software engineering
                    <br />
                    where I can contribute to impactful projects.
                    <br />
                    Long-term, I aim to combine my technical expertise with my artistic roots
                    <br />
                    to enter the game development industry.
